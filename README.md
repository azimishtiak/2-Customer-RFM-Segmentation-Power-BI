# Customer-RFM-Segmentation
RFM Segmentation is a customer analytics technique that classifies customers based on Recency (how recently they purchased), Frequency (how often they purchase), and Monetary (how much they spend). In my recent project, I applied RFM analysis to segment customers into behavior-based groups such as champions, loyal customers, potential loyalists, primising customers and customers who need attention and about to sleep. This enabled data-driven marketing strategies tailored to each segment, improving customer retention and campaign efficiency.
