# Customer-RFM-Segmentation
RFM Segmentation is a customer analytics technique that classifies customers based on Recency (how recently they purchased), Frequency (how often they purchase), and Monetary (how much they spend). In my recent project, I applied RFM analysis to segment customers into behavior-based groups such as champions, loyal customers, potential loyalists, primising customers and customers who need attention and about to sleep. This enabled data-driven marketing strategies tailored to each segment, improving customer retention and campaign efficiency.

### Assigning RFM Score
The RFM model scores each customer based on:
Recency (R) – How recently a customer made a purchase.
Higher recency score (e.g., 5) means the customer purchased more recently.

Frequency (F) – How often the customer makes purchases.
Frequent buyers receive a higher frequency score.

Monetary (M) – How much the customer has spent in total.
Customers who spend more receive a higher monetary score.

Each customer receives a score from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) for each R, F, and M metric. The combined RFM score (e.g., 555, 431) is used to classify customers into meaningful segments.
